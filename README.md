Ella is real-time search engine that augments surveillance systems with natural language search capabilities across recorded video footage. 
ella uses algorithmic deep learning tools to give any surveillance or security camera the ability to recognize objects, colors, people, vehicles, animals and more. ella makes every nanosecond of video searchable instantly, letting users type in keywords like “white truck” to find every relevant clip instead of searching through hours of footage. ella quite simply creates a Google for video.

With ella, video cameras used to view. Now, they can see.
